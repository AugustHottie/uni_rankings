# Data Visualization Project For Angelhack Monthly coding challange

This project involves the visualization of the dataset containing the rankings of universities around the world. The aim is to explore the data and derive insights about the performance of universities based on various factors.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available at [THE World University Rankings 2011-2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/r1chardson/the-world-university-rankings-2011-2023) . It contains information about the rankings of universities from 2011 to 2021, based on factors such as teaching score, research score, citations per faculty, and more.

## Tools and Technologies

The project is implemented using Python and various libraries such as,

 - pandas 
 - matplotlib
 - folium
 - Seaborn. 
 
The tools we have used are,

 - PowerBI
 - Canva
 
 The data is preprocessed, analyzed, and visualized using these tools and technologies.

## Visualizations

The following visualizations have been created as part of this project:

- Data covered over years from 2011-2021
  - General observations
  - Universites in the map
 
 
- DataStory of 2011 data
  - Co-relation between all the columns.
  - Average overall scores of universities by location
  - Teaching score vs Overall score
  - Research score vs Overall score
  - Top universities
 
- Data story of location and universities.
  - Location vs Overall Score
  - Number of universities by location
  - Industry income vs Location
 
## Conclusion

Through the visualizations, we can conclude that there is a significant variation in the performance of universities across the world. Some regions consistently perform better than others, while some universities have shown a consistent improvement in their rankings over the years.

- 2011 Data story.
  - Overall score or ranking is depends on the parameters teaching score, research score

- Locations and ranking
  - Location does impact the rankings but we can't say that confirmly because we don't have all the university data in 2011.
  - Location may impact the industry income
